# IntellMeet — Build Progress Log

Running record of what was built, why it was built that way, what is known to
be missing, and what comes next. Updated at the end of every phase.

## Phase 0 — Scaffold & Tooling ✅

**Completed:** 2026-09-23

### Built

- npm workspaces monorepo (`client`, `server`, `shared`) with root scripts
  `dev`, `build`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, `format`.
- `shared/` package: zod-first contract layer. Ships `healthResponseSchema`,
  compiled to `dist/` with type declarations so both sides consume real types.
- `server/`: Express 5 + TypeScript (ESM), `GET /api/health`, and a
  zod-validated environment loader that fails fast at startup.
- `client/`: React 19 + Vite 7 + Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui (new-york,
  neutral). Renders live API health fetched through the same-origin `/api` path.
- Tooling: ESLint 9 flat config, Prettier 3, Husky hooks, lint-staged,
  commitlint (Conventional Commits).
- `.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`, `.nvmrc` (Node 22).
- `docker-compose.yml` for local MongoDB 7 + Redis 7.
- `.env.example` for server and client; `README.md` and this file.

### Decisions & trade-offs

| Decision | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Vite dev proxy `/api` → `localhost:5000` instead of CORS in dev | Production sends REST through a Vercel rewrite so the browser sees the API as same-origin (keeping the refresh cookie first-party). Proxying in dev makes local behaviour match production instead of only working because CORS is open. |
| `shared/` compiled to `dist/` rather than consumed as raw TS | The server's production build (`tsc` → `dist`) cannot emit code that lives in `node_modules`. Building `shared` first keeps the Docker/Render build correct. Cost: `npm run dev` runs a third `tsc --watch` process. |
| ESM + `NodeNext` on the server (explicit `.js` in relative imports) | Matches Node 22's native module system and avoids a CJS/ESM interop layer later (BullMQ, Socket.io, ffmpeg tooling are all ESM-friendly). |
| `MONGODB_URI` / `REDIS_URL` optional in the env schema for now | Phase 0 must run with zero infrastructure — no Docker, no Atlas account. They become required in Phase 1 when the connections are actually opened. |
| Env vars validated as plain non-empty strings, not URLs | Real values use `mongodb+srv://` and `rediss://` schemes that URL validators treat inconsistently. |
| shadcn/ui configured by hand (`components.json` + `Button` + tokens) rather than running the interactive `init` | Deterministic and reviewable. `components.json` is the real thing, so `npx shadcn@latest add <component>` works normally from here. |
| `.nvmrc` = 22 while the dev machine runs Node 24 | The plan locks Node 22 LTS, which is what Docker/Render will use. `engines` is `>=22`, so Node 24 is fine locally. |
| ESLint uses `typescript-eslint` recommended (not type-checked) | Keeps `npm run lint` fast on a growing monorepo. Type errors are already caught by `npm run typecheck`. |

### Known limitations

- `GET /api/health` reports only process liveness. DB and Redis sub-checks land
  in Phase 1.
- No request logging, helmet, CORS middleware, rate limiting or error handler
  yet — that is Phase 1's middleware pipeline.
- Husky hooks are on disk but inert until the folder is a git repository and
  `npm run prepare` has been run once.
- On `npm run dev`, Vite serves the page a second or two before the API is
  listening, so the first health fetch can fail. The card has a **Re-check**
  button; a retry/suspense layer arrives with TanStack Query in Phase 4.
- `npm install` warns that `esbuild`'s postinstall script was blocked by npm's
  `allowScripts` policy. Harmless here — the prebuilt `@esbuild/win32-x64`
  binary is present and Vite builds fine.

### Checks

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run lint` | ✅ 0 errors, 0 warnings |
| `npm run typecheck` | ✅ clean in all 3 workspaces |
| `npm test` | ✅ 2 passed (1 server, 1 client) |
| `npm run build` | ✅ all 3 workspaces |
| `npm run dev` | ✅ client 5173 + API 5000; health reaches the page through the proxy |

### Manual verification performed

```
curl http://localhost:5173/api/health   → 200 {"status":"ok", ...}  (via Vite proxy)
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health   → 200 {"status":"ok", ...}  (direct)
curl http://localhost:5173/             → 200 (SPA shell)
```

### Next phase

**Phase 1 — Backend Foundation:** middleware pipeline (requestId → pino-http →
helmet → cors allowlist → 1 MB json limit → cookie-parser → sanitize → hpp →
routes → 404 → central error handler), `AppError` with typed codes, MongoDB and
Redis connections with retry, graceful shutdown, `validate(schema)` middleware,
and test infra (Vitest + Supertest + mongodb-memory-server).
